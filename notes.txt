```

I'm running the rclone as webserver on a GKE cluster and running a cronjob within the same cluster, to copy data from a AWS S3 bucket to GCS bucket, getting this EOF error. Sometimes it working and sometimes I get this error. There are lots of files that gets checked and then copies only the new files.
